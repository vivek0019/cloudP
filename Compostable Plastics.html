        <h2>Understanding Compostable Plastics</h2>
        <div class="compost-container">
            <div class="compost-card">
                <h3>Definition</h3>
                <p>Compostable plastics are designed to break down into natural, non-toxic elements such as water, carbon dioxide, and organic matter under composting conditions. They are typically made from renewable resources like starches or cellulose and are intended to reduce environmental impact.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="compost-card">
                <h3>How They Degrade</h3>
                <p>These plastics decompose through biological processes involving microorganisms. They require specific conditions—such as temperature, moisture, and oxygen—to break down effectively. Proper composting conditions ensure that compostable plastics degrade completely without leaving harmful residues.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="compost-card">
                <h3>Benefits</h3>
                <p>Compostable plastics offer environmental benefits by reducing landfill waste and pollution. When composted properly, they contribute to soil health and minimize the release of harmful chemicals. They provide a sustainable alternative to traditional plastics, especially in commercial composting facilities.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="compost-card">
                <h3>Applications</h3>
                <p>Compostable plastics are used in various applications, including packaging materials, disposable cutlery, and bags. They are particularly useful in settings where organic waste is collected and processed in composting systems designed to handle such materials.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="compost-card">
                <h3>Challenges</h3>
                <p>Despite their benefits, compostable plastics face challenges such as the need for specific composting conditions and the risk of contamination with non-compostable materials. Public awareness and proper waste management practices are crucial for their effective use.</p>
